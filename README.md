<h1>Customer-Churn_Analysis</h1>

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a major gas and electricity utility company. The goal is to understand the factors influencing customer retention and develop predictive models that help mitigate churn, particularly for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).


## Introduction
Understanding customer churn is vital for businesses, especially in competitive markets. Churn occurs when customers discontinue using a company's services, which can significantly impact revenue and growth. This project aims to uncover the key drivers of customer churn through data analysis and visualization, providing actionable insights for customer retention strategies.

## Process Overview
The project will be structured around three main analytical processes:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Assessing specific hypotheses regarding the relationship between pricing sensitivity and churn.
3. **Visualization**: Creating visual aids to convey findings effectively and inform decision-making.

## Data Sources
- **Customer Data**: Information on customer demographics, usage patterns, sign-up dates, and churn status.
- **Pricing Data**: Historical and current pricing models, including both fixed and variable rates.
- **Churn Indicator**: A binary variable indicating whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations and calculations.
  - `matplotlib`: For creating static visualizations.
  - `seaborn`: For advanced data visualizations and statistical graphics.
  - `scikit-learn`: For implementing machine learning algorithms (if modeling is performed).
